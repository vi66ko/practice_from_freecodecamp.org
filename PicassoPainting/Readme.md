## [Link to the course in the freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-intermediate-css-by-building-a-picasso-painting/step-1)

To be honest I didn't see that much as a course. I felt it was more like a practice.
As well why  Picasso, isn't it the point of a course or learning to know what I am doing. May be is just me but I can't understand that picture therefore I don't know exactly what element I am shaping. Even when I am looking at the HTML elements is hard to understand them much.
This is just my opinion.
I think it will be better if the picture is not so abstract, instead to be more real (by real I do not mean realistic )and concrete.
Thank you for all your effort and all the free resource!!
